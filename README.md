## Overview
The Ocean View Restaurant Page is a creative project designed to demonstrate my grasp of advanced programming concepts and design principles. While inspired by the concept of building a restaurant page from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), the functionality, design, and implementation are entirely original. This includes:
- Custom imagined restaurant theme, name, and visuals.
- Integration of **SOLID principles** into the JavaScript structure.
- Use of Webpack for modular code management.
- Personalized design decisions and enhanced user experience.

## Features
- **Homepage**: A warm welcome section, hero image, and introduction to the restaurant.
- **Menu**: A visually appealing menu section with images, names, and prices of dishes.
- **About Us**: A descriptive section highlighting the restaurantâ€™s uniqueness.
- **Contact**: Contact details for easy communication.
- **Responsive Navbar**: A hamburger menu for smooth navigation on all devices.
- **Custom Icons**: Icons sourced from [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).
- **Native Fonts**: No external font libraries were used.

## Color Palette
The following color palette was used to maintain a cohesive and visually pleasing design:

- **Primary Background Color**: #EEEDEB (Light Cream - Used for general backgrounds)
- **Secondary Background Color**: #092635 (Dark Blue - Used in the header and welcome section background)
- **Primary Text Color**: #1B4242 (Teal - Used for headings and key texts)
- **Secondary Text Color**: #092635 (Dark Blue - Used for paragraph text)

- **Shadow Color**: #d7d4cf (Soft Gray - Used for box shadows)

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Implemented with modular design principles.
- **SOLID Principles**: The project adheres to these principles for maintainability and scalability.
- **Webpack**: Used for module bundling and asset management.
- **CSS**: Styled using custom CSS for a responsive and modern design.
- **Pictogrammers Icons**: Icons sourced for added visual appeal.
- **Native CSS Fonts**: Leveraged system fonts for consistency and performance.

## Learning Objectives
This project was created as part of my learning journey to:
- Understand and apply the **SOLID principles** in JavaScript.
- Gain hands-on experience with **Webpack** for efficient project management.
- Enhance design skills using **color theory** and accessibility standards.
- Build a fully responsive website from scratch using modular and reusable code.
- Practice integrating custom assets, including images and icons.

## Credits
- **Inspiration**: Conceptual guidance was derived from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), but the implementation, design, and added principles are entirely my own.
- **Icons**: Icons used are from [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).
- **Images**: Placeholder images were sourced randomly and credited in the footer section of the website.
